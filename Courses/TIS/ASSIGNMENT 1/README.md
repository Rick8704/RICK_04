<h1 align="left"> Reflection on the talk by Mr.Habib (GetMehired) & PPG: </h1>
<p>During Mr. Habib's initial presentation, he emphasized the importance of commencing the construction of our resumes or portfolios early on, rather than waiting until after graduation. The rationale behind this advice is the preference for a gradual approach, progressing semester by semester, as opposed to assembling it hastily post-graduation. Delaying the preparation until the last minute may result in overlooking crucial elements. Inspired by his talk, I've decided to initiate the process of crafting my portfolio now, methodically filling in each section to ensure its completeness and a well-organized structure.

As for the PPG talk, it presented an opportunity for me to delve deeper into our career prospects post-graduation. They furnished us with insights into our future professions and guidance on addressing challenges shared by alumni. Recognizing the significance of having a long-term career development plan, I aim to start crafting my own plan now, enabling me to formulate concrete strategies to achieve my goals upon graduation. I am committed to garnering diverse experiences, whether through coursework or internships, with the objective of distinguishing myself. The key takeaway from these discussions is the concept of "learning nonstop," underscoring the necessity to continually acquire new skills and knowledge to enhance one's capabilities.</p>
