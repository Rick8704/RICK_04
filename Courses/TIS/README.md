<h2 align="left"> Reflection: </h2>
<p>The amalgamation of information systems and technology (IS/IT) into our daily routines has become indispensable, giving rise to what is referred to as Technology and Information Systems (TIS). TIS encompasses an extensive array of IS/IT components, spanning hardware, software, networks, and communication systems. Throughout this semester, I've acquired fundamental skills in PC installation and proficiency with productivity tools such as GitHub through practical engagement in labs and assignments.

Moreover, Dr. Aryati facilitated industry visits, a pivotal facet of the work-based learning within this course. These visits and discussions imparted invaluable insights into the actual operational milieu, augmenting my comprehension of the industry. The course has deepened my insight into the qualifications requisite for my future career aspirations.</p>
